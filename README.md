Project design guide:

- Use tabs for indents.

- If a feature is unstable or unfinished, make it clear by adding comments
about its state after namespaces but before the class/struct keyword.



Folder explanations:

- Objects: Things you'd expect to visibly make up scenes.

- System: Features that give off engine vibes more than game ones.

- Types: Structs which are vital for managing spacial data.
